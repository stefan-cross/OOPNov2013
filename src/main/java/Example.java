// OVERVIEW: A brief description of the behaviour of the type's objects goes here

// ABSTRACT FUNCTION: explains the interpretation of the rep, mapping state of each legal representation object to
// the abstract object it is intended to represent

// Defining which representations are legal by mapping each rep object to either true (if the rep is legal) or false
// (if its rep is not legal
//
