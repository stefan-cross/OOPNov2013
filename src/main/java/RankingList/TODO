Current state:

Now have a cmdln interface to add tracks to a lib and return the lib stack

TODO 1 - convert stack to list/set currently pop removes the elements,
TODO 2 - we need a getNext/iterator to access elements not removing them
TODO 3 - we need a comparator to prevent adding the same track artist and title
TODO 4 - need to then access a track and inc plays and downloads so we have something to arrange the library by
TODO 5 - Explore the idea of having a library list, and artist lists of tracks...

...The idea of having a Library that contains all the tracks and the rankinglist iterates through the lib
to create listing by downloads or plays...



Write out specs and uml
write tests
write iterator and generator to produce data
